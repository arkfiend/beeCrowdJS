This project aims to provide guidance on how to solve problems on the [BeecrowdÂ´s](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) website utilizing JavaScript. 
The solutions are listed in numerical order to make it easier to find and understand specific problems. 
It is important to not simply copy and paste the provided code, but rather to use it as a reference and strive to understand and master JavaScript.

## How to test these codes 
Its pretty easy to test or running theses codes. All you gonna need is:
* Install Node 14 or superior
* Save your code as an .js archive
* (Utilizing a prompt, call) node nameOfYourArchive.js
And thatÂ´s it!
